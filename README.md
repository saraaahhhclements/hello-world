Introduction to git tutorial

Hello, 

My name is Sarah Clements. I'm a 4th year MIS (Management Information Systems) major with a minor in Computer Science. 
I'm from Alpena, Mi and I've gotten to have a few different homes these last few summers through internship opportunities. 
I'm the President of AIS (the Association for Information Systems), and I am the VP of Finance for the Husky Game Development Enterprise.
I've won awards for Most Grilled Cheeses eaten and people have very good things to say about my homemade chocolate cake.
